## Context : 
The association "Les têtes à clic" works in nursery and primary schools
to teach students how to use software. It also develops small
computer board games for children. Trainee in this association, you
are responsible for developing a program allowing two children to compete in a
part of Yams.

## General presentation of the project
Creation of a yams game exclusively in C language by passing several steps such as :
- model
- test book
- pseudo-code algorithm
- source code

## Steps explanation 
### Step 1 : 
To start I needed to create a model of my game so that during the coding stage I would have an idea of what the interface of my game should look like.

### Step 2 :
Secondly I set up a test book before the next steps to allow me to target the key steps and have an idea of the different procedures and functions that I was going to have to use for the development. Then later fill this test book with the results of the source code


### Step 3 :
Using pseudo-code specific to my establishment to create a model of my source code, which consists of establishing the main function and the header of each function and procedure

### Step 4 :
Final source code development
